# NTU-EE6227-Genetic-Algorithm-Assginment

Running main.m will provide the results of each iteration of the genetic algorithm and the corresponding genotypes of the parent and offspring for each generation.

The parameters that can be modified in main.m are:

1. "seeds" for random number seeds, which can be modified as needed.

2. "matric" for the last three digits of your student ID.

3. "end_epoch" for the total number of iterations.

4. "mate_per_epoch" for the number of pairings per iteration.
